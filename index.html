                His name is Gros Grognon. <span class='texte'>I love his soft fur </span> even if it takes hours to untangle and if you spill curry on him his fur is dyed for ever. I aslo have to his bangs every week because he doesn’t like hair in his face. It make him winks in an uncontrollable way. But too short of a bang makes him look like a french granny from the 16th district of Paris.

        
       <span class='fleur'>*</span >

                And even if some people thinks that he looks like a granny dog he is a thug. He doesn’t rise suspicions.<span class='texte'> He is a stylish dog.</span> He even lost one tooth biting on a green croc in the metro and hates dread locks on dogs.

        <span  class='fleur'>*</span >


                Gros Grognon is french but <span class='texte'>he likes german</span > bitches.

              The last time I saw him was is poppies flower field that <span class='texte'>he grows for opium.</span > he has to earn money to buy diamonds collars for the bitches. I am very proud of his entreprenor skills. 
            I am scared some rivals kidnapped him. or maybe he tried to seduce some bitches he should have not.

        
        <span  class='fleur'>*</span >
        

            
                I absolutely can’t put posters in the streets saying he is missing because it would be bad for his buisness and reputation.<span class='texte'>Soon I will probably going to have to hire a doberman detective.</span >And even if he doesn’t like me to say it in public he is a good boy.
